                <p id="text">When I'm inside my mind feels small and my body feels big. My mind feels small and my emotions feel big. My hand on my face is a gesture too big for the screen. When I roll over in my bed the neighbors can hear the bed creak, can feel the impact.

                <br>
                <br>

                When I'm outside you cannot tell if its tears or mist or rain. You cannot tell the difference between a scream and the silence.

                <br>
                <br>

                When I die in my bed it is a mess. There is blood everywhere and everyone knows. Everyone sees. No one forgets. My body is preserved and lives forever without me.

                <br>
                <br>

                When I die outside, I disappear. No one hears, no one sees, and no one knows. I am forgotten immediately. My body already become something else.</p>
